# Summary

A devfile-based application stack for Open Liberty built with Gradle

# Open Liberty Application Stack

The Open Liberty application stack provides a consistent way of developing microservices based upon the [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/) and [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io) specifications. This stack lets you use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to develop applications for [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io) runtime, that is running on OpenJDK with container-optimizations in OpenJ9.

This stack is based on OpenJDK with container-optimizations in OpenJ9 and Open Liberty. It provides live reloading during development by utilizing the ["dev mode"](https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/10/22/liberty-dev-mode.html) capability in the liberty-gradle-plugin.  

**Note:** Gradle is provided by the stack, allowing you to build, test, and debug your Java application without installing Gradle locally.
